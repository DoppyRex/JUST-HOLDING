Compatibility Notes
===============================================================================

The updated files included in Jailbreak III Service Pack 1 are designed to be
network-compatible with unpatched Jailbreak III.

That means that you'll still be able to join and play on a game server that is
running base Jailbreak III without version mismatches; and that server admins
can safely update their servers with Jailbreak III Service Pack 1 without
preventing players running base Jailbreak III from joining and playing on their
server.

Changes/Fixes
===============================================================================

Botmatch fixes:

  * No occasional initial spawning in the wrong base anymore. Start spot is
    always validated against your team before you spawn.


Game server and more botmatch changes:

  * No more occasional server crashes (or at least no more than usual for
    Unreal Tournament servers).

  * Performance increase in terms of processor resources. Game servers with
    many players or botmatches with a lot of bots will run much smoother.
  
  * New option to balance all-human teams if they're unbalanced by one player.
    The game adds a bot to the smaller team then to balance the teams even if
    the total number of players exceeds the server's MinPlayers.
  
  * Arena fights aren't started during a release.
  
  * Llamaizing release protection now also kills jail campers and respawns them
    in their home base with default health, weapons and no armor. In addition,
    they get a comprehensive on-screen message that explains why that happened.

  * Client compass always points to the correct release switch.

  * Balancing by skill fixed.

  * Plain-text version of web admin interface templates included. To use them
    on dedicated Linux servers, copy them from the Web/plaintext subdirectory
    into the Web directory.
  
  * Plain-text version of public game stats page included. To use it, rename
    the file System\JBServerAdmin-plaintext.int to JBServerAdmin.int and
    restart your server. If you want to customize this page, have a look into
    that file and into jail_stats.uhtm or jail_stats_plaintext.uhtm.
  
  * JBCampkill automatically disabled if it's accidentally being run. Use the
    built-in release protection settings instead.
  
  * Fixed web admin interface for Macintosh computers. Two of the template
    files had file names that were too long for Macs.


Game client and even more botmatch changes:

  * Vastly faster server browser; ping all Jailbreak servers in a few seconds.
    Credits for figuring it all out go to Eavy, http://eavy.beyondunreal.com.

  * Performance increase as detailed above. Framerate vastly improved in some
    maps (your mileage may vary).
  
  * Client and server Jailbreak versions displayed in F2 server info screen.
    When reporting problems, please be sure to include both version tags.
  
  * Instantaneous crouching.
  
  * Low-fi release protection effect duly disappears after release protection
    ends, and has the right color from the very beginning.
  
  * New option to display numerical ping and play time in the scoreboard. In
    addition, a default scoreboard sort order can be set.
  
  * Various HUD fixes: Crosshair is displayed even if the player has configured
    the HUD to be hidden at all times, and the health status box's opacity
    matches the HUD's configured settings rather than being always translucent.
  
  * Screen doesn't crash Unreal Tournament anymore when recording a demo while
    a web, chat or server slide updates its contents.
  
  * Extended language localization support.

Umod Installation
===============================================================================

Double-click the umod file and follow the instructions on the screen.


===============================================================================
Zip Installation
===============================================================================

The zip file includes information about in which subdirectories the files
should be placed; simply extract all files in your UnrealTournament folder, and
all files should go where they belong to.

If that doesn't work out, extract the files manually into the following
directories:

  UnrealTournament\Help      *.txt
  UnrealTournament\System    *.u
  UnrealTournament\Web       *.uhtm
