Team K9 Power Pack
==================

Author: Team K9 - Chezdog, Snowdog & Spoondog

Release Date: Tuesday, September 9, 2003


The maps are all designed to be fast and furious.  Detailed maps with close combat and wicked
gameplay are what you'll find here (hence the name "Power Pack").  The maps are all new, apart
from one CTF conversion (Sprinta), and you will find some extremely new and original stuff,
including a new weapon!


Got lots of credit to give out here:

Thanks to Wormbo for a number of scripts for the pack, including the Snowgun in Frostbite
and the DefaultWeaponMutator in Doom. Big thanks to Sexmachine and Rob for bringing the Jailbreak
touch to Arboria, Doom, and Frostbite, great job! and especially to Sexmachine for the use of his
server, his hosting, and for creating the distribution packages... and for generally motivating
(whipping) us to get this finished!

The pack has been sitting around for about a year, RealLife among other things getting in
the way, but now it comes to the community complete and ready for your enjoyment!

Go nuts!

BTW:  keep your eye out for the CTF version of this Power Pack.
